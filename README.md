Distributed logging system

End to end distributed logging system, including both log recording and presentation layers.

Each device in the network can have multiple different logging nodes, recording and displaying different parts of the log.

All nodes are assumed to be occasionally connected to the internet, but they are not required to be regularly or often connected

This is currently a WIP, the next step is to take the current setup that works on one machine and distribute.  Going to use git to 
manage version control.

Functionality needed, git pull, git commit, git push
